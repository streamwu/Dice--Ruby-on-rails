This is a dice game created with Rails. 

### Rules

* A user can roll the dice to start the game.
* If the user's first roll is a 7 or 11, the user wins.
* If the user's first roll is a 2, 3 or 12, the user loses.
* Anything else becomes the user's goal.
* Have the user roll for their goal again before rolling a 7, and they win.
* If the user rolls a 7 instead of their goal, they lose.
* A user should be able to restart the game after a win or loss.
